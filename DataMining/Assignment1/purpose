The purpose of this assignment was to get familiar with organizing data using pandas.

The first part was creating a tokenized list of words from the gettysburg address with word counts.
This is a useful webscraping skill which we go over and use more in later assignments

The second part was familiarizing myself with pandas which I used to organize .csv spreadsheet data.
