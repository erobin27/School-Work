The purpose of this assignment was to implement and understand the pagerank algorithm.
An algorithm used by Google to rank pages in order of relevance based on how many pages
link back to the page in question.

"The PageRank algorithm outputs a probability distribution used to represent the likelihood
that a person randomly clicking on links will arrive at any particular page."
